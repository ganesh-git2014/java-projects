3

2. On a scale from 1 to 5, where one is “much worse code” and five is “much bet-ter code”, what impact did the Paired Programming methodology have in terms of the number of bugs and overall quality of the code you produced (compared to your normal code).
4

3. On a scale from 1 to 5, where one is “much slower than” and five is “much faster than”, how much more quickly do you find the Paired Programming de-velopment experience compared to your normal code development practices.

4. If you have two people to work on the same small software project, which do you think is a more effective allocation of the two people a. Assign one person to design and write the code and one person to develop tests for the code b. Assign one person to design, write and test ½ of the functions/classes in the code and assign the other person to design, write and test the other half. c. Use Paired Programming and have both people work simultane-ously on all aspects of the code d. Other arrangement/allocation of the two people (explain in 20 words or fewer)
